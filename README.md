# project2-blackjack

README : 

A Blackjack simulator that allows you to play against the computer.  This project revolves heavily on object-oriented programming.  I created a class “Card” that creates objects that saves two values that would normally be found on a playing card: a numerical value, and a “suit” value.  52 of these objects are created and kept track of in a different class which represents a deck of cards.  The cards are shuffled, then the player and the computer are dealt these cards to play out a game of blackjack.

BLACK JACK PROJECT 2:

Card.java:  This is the code that allows me to construct individual cards.  

Hand.java:  This is the code that keeps track of each hand that is dealed.

DeckOfCards.java:  This code constructs a deck of cards to use during the game.  

Black Jack.java:  This code is what initiates the game and uses multiple classes to operate the game.
